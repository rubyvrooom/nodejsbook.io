### Collaborative documentation for node

The brains over at [nodejitsu][1] created a great [collaborative documentation project][6] for the recent [Node Knockout][2] event. The project allows anyone to contribute via the [GitHub][3] repository, so if you are learning something new with node why not write it up, fork the project and send a pull request? Or if you want to get started with node, or are looking to skill up further there are already some great resources available including:

* [How to parse command line arguments][3]
* [How to store local configuration data][4]
* [How do I read files in node.js?][5]

Perhaps not the sexiest of entries for Node Knockout I suspect this may become one of the most useful. Documentation and resources for learning node are in short supply so this is great. Thanks nodejitsu!
